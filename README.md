> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Sloth.css is still heavily work-in-progress. The package is not yet published.

Check [the documentation](https://slothcss.devmount.com) to see it in action.

## Installation

Include the following CSS file in your HTML head to get the complete package (drop-in core styles, utility classes and CSS components):

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@devmount/sloth.css@1/sloth.min.css" />
```

If you just want to use the drop-in core styles, the utility classes or the CSS components only, you can use one of these:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@devmount/sloth.css@1/sloth.core.min.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@devmount/sloth.css@1/sloth.util.min.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@devmount/sloth.css@1/sloth.comp.min.css" />
```

## Features

Sloth.css can be used as drop-in CSS library, or additionally with curated utility classes or even with a set of handcrafted ready-to-copy components. Styles are opinionated (then again: which styles are not), and crafted to prioritize visual usability over trends such as flat design. For example: Elements where you type in (like input fields) are actually inset, elements that are clickable (like buttons) are actually outstanding, tabs are connected to the content they activate etc.

Also, Sloth.css aims to be:

- Lightweight (3.8KB gzipped)
- Responsive and mobile-friendly
- Beautiful per default but customisable
- Working for all modern browsers
