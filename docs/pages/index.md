    A drop-in utility component CSS library for lazy mammals.<br />

## Installation

Include the following CSS file in your HTML head to get the complete package:

```html
<!-- Sloth.css drop-in core styles, utility classes and components, ~14.5KB gzipped -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ cdnUrl }}/sloth.min.css" />
```

Read on below to find out about all available variants. Maybe one of them is more suitable for your use case.

## Features

Sloth.css can be used as drop-in CSS library, as utility class library or even with a set of handcrafted ready-to-copy components. Or everything, all at once. Just pick the variant you need. Styles are opinionated (then again: which styles are not), and crafted to prioritize visual usability over trends such as flat design. For example: Elements where you type in (like input fields) are actually inset, elements that are clickable (like buttons) are actually elevated, tabs are connected to the content they activate etc.

### Variant 1: Drop-in core CSS library

The drop-in core of Sloth.css provides styles for all plain HTML elements without the use of a single class. If you have a page using semantic markup, just include the following CSS file and everything will get some nice basic styling.

```html
<!-- Sloth.css drop-in core styles, ~2.7KB gzipped -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ cdnUrl }}/sloth.core.min.css" />
```

### Variant 2: Utility classes CSS library

If you want to create quick mockups without leaving your markup, you can use Sloth.css with utility classes. Just take a look at the docs to see, which ones are available. Those utility classes are a curated subset of Tailwind CSS classes (with a few exceptions and additions) and are meant to be extended and adapted by you for your project. I had several projects, where Tailwind was not necessary (or not possible or not wanted), so instead I used a convenient set of utility classes I curated myself and found, that those were mostly sufficient for those projects. So here they are.

```html
<!-- Sloth.css utility classes, ~1.8KB gzipped -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ cdnUrl }}/sloth.util.min.css" />
```

### Variant 3: CSS components collection

If you need more advanced elements on your page, you can use Sloth.css with prestyled components included. Badges, Cards, Modals, Tooltips and more - take a look at the complete list in the docs.
