## Usage

The most lazy usage of Sloth.css is to do nothing. Sloth.css offers drop-in styles for all native HTML elements, letting your semantic markup shine without any effort and without a single class.

If you like classes though &mdash; utility classes in particluar, Sloth.css got you covered. You can take a look at the [utilities section](/utilities/border) to see the complete list of available utility classes. Those are a curated subset of Tailwind CSS classes (with a few exceptions) and are meant to be extended and adapted by you for your project. There are valid use cases and reasons, to _not_ use Tailwind CSS or an additional build step in a project and this is where Sloth.css provides the simplicity of a ready-to-include CSS file.

For some more advanced UI elements on your page, you can use prestyled components like badges, cards, modals, tooltips and more &mdash; check out the complete list in the [components section](/components/badge).
